# H2VK - A Vulkan based educational graphic engine 

```
H for Hydrogen. The first element of the periodic table.
And the comburant used by the first successful internal combustion engine.
```

An small graphic engine developed as a side-project to learn the Vulkan API, improve C++ skills and gather graphic computing knowledge.

Given that this project is recent, the list of features implemented remains short.
A long term goal aim at using this work to render solutions obtained from physic simulations with closure modelling.
